Hi! This is the README for Your Emissary. Your Emissary is a system designed to interact with internet on your behalf. This includes sending emails, scheduling events, searching through notes, and much much more.

It's designed with the number one priority of being private and secure. To this end, it is intended to function offline as much as (inhumanly) possible. I'm also releasing the source code so anyone can use, reproduce, and modify the code for themselves.

# Requirements
